CMake Error at build/vcpkg_installed/x64-windows/share/openal-soft/OpenALConfig.cmake:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
Error:   Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 has been removed from CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.

  Or, add -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 to try configuring anyway.
